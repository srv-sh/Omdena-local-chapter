Nick Street said.Five passengers remained in critical condition Friday night, and the death toll could rise, he said.All 31 people on board were hurt. Twelve to 15 were considered in critical condition shortly after the crash, but several of them have since improved, Street said. Not everyone was wearing a seatbelt, as is common in tour buses, he said.The crash happened near a highway rest stop a few miles from southern Utah's Bryce Canyon National Park, an otherworldly landscape of narrow red-rock spires.Authorities believe the driver swerved on the way to the park on Friday morning, but when he yanked the steering wheel to put the bus back onto the road the momentum sent the bus into a rollover crash.The driver, an American citizen, survived and was talking with investigators, Street said. The driver didn't appear intoxicated, but authorities were still investigating his condition as well as any possible mechanical problems, he said.There was some wind but not strong enough to cause problems, Street said.The crash left the top of the white bus smashed inward and one side peeling away as the vehicle came to rest mostly off the side of the road against a sign for restrooms.The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team to investigate.The company listed on the bus was America Shengjia Inc. Utah business records indicate it is based in Monterey Park, California. A woman answering the phone there did not have immediate comment.Injured victims were sent to three hospitals. Intermountain Garfield Memorial Hospital said it received 17 patients, including three in critical condition and 11 in serious condition.Patients also were taken to Cedar City and St. George hospitals.Millions of people visit Utah's five national parks every year. Last year, about 87,000 people from China visited the state, making them the fastest-growing group of Utah tourists, according to state data.More than half of visitors from China travel on tour buses, said Vicki Varela, managing director of Utah Office of Tourism.The Chinese Embassy tweeted that it was saddened to learn of the crash and that it was sending staff to help the victims.Bryce Canyon, about 300 miles (480 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City, draws more than 2 million visitors a year.""You have a group from China who have worked hard to come to the states, got the visa and everything they needed, excited about it, and for a tragedy like this to happen it just makes it all the more tragic,"" Street said."

There are footbridges on 10 percent national highway intersections while 1 percent in regional highway intersections.“There’s fixed space for bus stoppage on 14 percent of national highway intersections while 1 percent of regional highway intersections. There was no proper signaling system for drivers and pedestrians in 30 percent intersections. The main problems in intersections include illegal parking of CNG-run auto-rickshaws and leguna,” the keynote paper said.It also suggested introducing continuous pedestrian walkway (100m-200m), guardrail protecting pedestrian walkway, appropriate curb design at crossing facility, pedestrian footbridge/underpass, preferable shaded, flashing amber light for pedestrian crossing (for vehicle); pedestrian crossing signal and lighting facility. Recommendations also include rumble strip approaching intersection, surveillance camera, channelisation, drainage, installation of signs (all 3 types) and no large trees near intersection obstructing visibility.Prof Dr Md Mizanur Rahman, director of the Accident Research Institute at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet), said the road accidents must be reduced by 2020 to achieve SDGs.“We, engineers, propose plans but these are not implemented properly. Some 24 percent drivers and 34 percent passengers die in road accidents in our country,” he said. Prof Mizanur said engineers’ recommendations should be taken into consideration to bring discipline on roads.Quoting of the UN, Nirapad Sarak Chai (We Demand Safe Roads) founder Ilias Kanchan said the road crash is not a disease but a man-made problem. “The road safety issue should be included in school textbooks and exam should be taken on the topics to create awareness. Besides, laws must be enforced strictly to bring all those responsible for road crashes to justice.”As the chief guest of the event, Road Transport and Highways Division Secretary Md Nazrul Islam said the government may build footbridges but people have to use those. “So, awareness and enforcement of laws are needed.”He also said they are arranging mass hearings to create awareness among people in different districts of the country. “We’ll take all the possible steps but everyone has to be responsible,” he also said.Chief Engineer of Roads and Highways Department Ibne Alam Hasan who presided over the programme said they took various steps, including four-lane roads, to reduce road accidents. “Road accidents will come down by around 85 percent if intersections are properly used.”"
